# Leica_Total_Station_ROS

Operating and Controlling the Leica Total Station for Origin Mapping, Visual Servoing and Reference Fiducial. 

A total station (TS) or total station theodolite (TST) is an electronic/optical instrument used for surveying and building construction. It is an electronic transit theodolite integrated with electronic distance measurement (EDM) to measure both vertical and horizontal angles and the slope distance from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform triangulation calculations.[1]

Robotic or motorized total stations allow the operator to control the instrument from a distance via remote control. This eliminates the need for an assistant staff member as the operator holds the retroreflector and controls the total station from the observed point. These motorized total stations can also be used in automated setups knows as Automated Motorized Total Station (AMTS). 

# Access to LTS Station 
Plugin into the LTS and launch the Leica_ros file 
roslaunch leica_ros leica_ros.launch 
roslaunch ltf ltf.launch 

This is trigger and set the the LTS to appropriate prism type for tracking and origin mapping based on P3P problem set
